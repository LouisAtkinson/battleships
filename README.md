This is a rendition of the classic Battleships game. It can be found at this link:

To begin, click start and enter your name. Then you can choose the placement of your ships. Once you have placed all five ships, the game begins; your board is displayed on the left, and the computer's board, with five randomly placed hidden ships, is on the right. Guess where the computer's ships are located by clicking on its board; a miss is indicated by yellow, and a hit by red. There is accompanying descriptive text too. The computer will guess random squares. Once you or the computer have hit each square occupied by a ship (and therefore sank them all), a win/lose message is displayed. along with the option to play again.
